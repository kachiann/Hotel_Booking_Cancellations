# Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

INN Hotels Group faces significant revenue loss due to booking cancellations. This project aims to develop a machine learning solution to predict cancellation likelihood, enabling proactive measures to mitigate losses.


## Objective

Develop a machine learning model to forecast booking cancellation probabilities, allowing for:

1. **Dynamic pricing strategies:** Adjust room rates based on predicted cancellation probabilities.
2. **Targeted retention campaigns:** Identify high-risk bookings for personalized retention efforts.
3. **Optimized overbooking policies:** Manage reservations more effectively to minimize revenue loss due to cancellations.

By accurately predicting cancellations, INN Hotels Group can minimize inventory loss and maximize revenue.
